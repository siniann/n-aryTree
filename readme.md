Mindmaps can be represented as an n-ary tree in which each node can have any number of children 

Every Tree is itself a subtree, so every node an instance of Tree.

A user can have multiple mindmaps.

Execute `npm install` and  `npm run start ` to see the sample which creates users and their mindmaps.
